# 🌍 GEM Foundation

Welcome to the **Global Earthquake Model (GEM) Foundation** GitHub repository!

GEM is a non-profit organization dedicated to advancing global earthquake hazard and risk assessment through open data, software, and scientific research. Our goal is to improve earthquake preparedness and resilience worldwide by developing state-of-the-art tools and methodologies.

## 🚀 About GEM

Founded in 2009, the **GEM Foundation** brings together experts, institutions, and stakeholders from around the world to create open, transparent, and accessible earthquake risk models. Our work supports:

- Disaster risk reduction
- Insurance and financial sector risk management
- Engineering and infrastructure resilience
- Public policy and decision-making

We believe that **open science and collaboration** are essential to reducing seismic risk globally.

## 🔬 What We Do

### 📊 **OpenQuake Engine**
The **OpenQuake Engine** is our flagship open-source software for probabilistic seismic hazard and risk assessment. See the pinned OpenQuake Engine repository below.

### 🗺️ **Global Earthquake Hazard and Risk Models**
We develop and maintain global, regional, and national-scale earthquake hazard and risk models, providing critical data for informed decision-making. See below our pinned repositories for the GEM Building Taxonomy, the Global Exposure Model, the Global Vulnerability Model, the Global Earthquake Impact Database.

### 📚 **Training & Capacity Development**
Through workshops, online courses, and collaborative projects, we share, exchange, and develop knowledge with communities and institutions, empowering them to assess and mitigate seismic risk while continuously learning from local expertise and real-world applications.

### 🌎 **Collaborative Research & Partnerships**
GEM collaborates with international organizations, universities, and both public and private-sector partners to advance earthquake science and risk reduction.
